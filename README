This code was written for CS346 Spring 2011, Stanford University by 
nandu@cs.stanford.edu.

This code was placed online after requests from other students in my 
class AFTER the completion of the course. Since then, this code has
been used as a reference by many students globally.

Please do not violate the Stanford University or other Honor code by 
directly copying/reading this code for your own coursework.
